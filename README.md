# Client SDK for GDPR

**THIS CLIENT SDK IS IN BETA**

USING THIS CLIENT SDK DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT AN ORGANIZATION IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLYING WITH GDPR.

The GDPR Client SDK is an open source project that you can consider as a starter kit for making your application compliant with EU GDPR (European Global Data Protection Regulation). The goal of this project is to give organizations something to start with and to play with to adapt their applications to the GDPR requirements.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this project are software companies and organizations/businesses with an internal IT development team, which can install, customize and implement features based on their real needs. If you are an end-user company, you should ask your software vendor for support to customize, install, and use this solution.

## Architecture
Out of the box, the Client SDK uses GdprHq.Io API. However, you can implement your own API or use Client SDK without any API integrations.

## Supported Languages
* C# - https://github.com/gdprhq/GdprHq.Io.ClientSdk.CSharp
* VB.NET (coming soon)
* NodeJS (coming soon)
* JAVA (coming soon)
* Delphi (coming soon)
* Python (coming soon)
* Ruby (coming soon)
